     <h1>Hello I'm Clara</h1>
     <p>I am a freshman here at The New School in New York. I am originally from Atlanta and love living in a big city so being in New York is so exciting and I have had so much fun this semester meeting people, exploring the city, thrifting, and exploring even more.!</p>
